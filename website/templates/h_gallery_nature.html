							When referring to nature in this context, we’re talking about the untouched natural environment. Areas that have had little, or no human intervention. Nature is the physical world - brimming with life and filled with motion, including sounds, smells, and sights.

						<h1><a href="#">Blue Mind State vs Red Mind State</a></h1>

							There’s a lot of talk about cell phone addiction, the dangers of blue light, over-stimulation, and pollution. The results of this electric energy are referred to as the red mind state. Spending too long indoors on devices and surrounded by man-made objects knocks the body out of balance. According to the American Psychological Association, over 90% of young adults are addicted to continually checking their mobile devices. 

							In contrast, spending time in nature brings our whole system back into harmony. Author Richard Louv coined the term “nature-deficit disorder” as a way of describing the loss of connection with the natural world. The “red mind state” is the polar opposite of the “blue mind state”. Red is appropriately a color associated with fear and intense emotions. While blue is a color associated with depth and stability.

							In general, exercise is great, but one study from the University of Michigan showed participants who took a memory test and then walked in nature did 20% better than those who took the test and then took a walk around the city. Mother Earth knows what she’s doing.  
							According to one Finnish study, spending just 15 minutes sitting in nature helped people feel psychologically restored. Those results were even faster when they spent that time walking.
							One study shows that people exposed to more natural light healed faster from a spinal surgery and reportedly had less pain than others. It seems nature served as a natural drug for them, because they also took fewer pain medications.  
							Taking a break in nature can improve your concentration  by giving your brain a well-needed break. Leave your phone behind and let your mind unwind from the overstimulation so common with modern, busy life.  
							Being outside may not be a magical diet pill all by itself, but it does tend to make exercise more enjoyable. What’s more, some aspects of outdoor exercise like hiking may help you lose weight in an unexpected way. Spending time at higher altitudes can speed up your metabolism and lower your appetite.
							Spending time in the sun helps your body create vitamin D—a vitamin that studies have shown may help prevent cancer, osteoporosis, and heart attacks.
							Being in mother nature, even if just in your own neighborhood, can reduce stress in the body. Studies show spending time outdoors can lower your heart rate—a symptom of stress.
